# Durhide
Durhide is an app combining government traffic camera data with a visual map, to show the locations of these cameras, live feeds, and notifications when you are passing them. Think of this as an app both for governments and those who fear 'Big Brother' (not the TV show, although that's equally as scary).

## Backend
The Backend API is deployed on Heroku, running Django. The Django site requires PostgreSQL. Unless you want to host your own service, this shouldn't concern you.

## Android App

The Android app supports Android 19, although we recommend Android 25 (Nougat), as that's what we have been testing with.
The APK must be signed to allow for Google Play Services to work correctly.

The app shall be available on the Play Store shortly.
